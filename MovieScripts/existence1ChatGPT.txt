INT. OFFICE - DAY

The fluorescent lights buzz softly above Chris Rowe (early 30s, programmer, deep thinker) as he sits at his desk, a slight frown crossing his face. A screen in front of him glows, displaying a build error. His fingers hover over the keyboard, tapping rhythmically.

ON SCREEN:

Error Message:

MSB4025: The project file could not be loaded. Could not find file 'C:\Users\chris.rowe\source\repos\Existenc\Existence.csproj'.

Chris:
(quietly to himself)
I hate it when it does that.

He leans back in his chair, deep in thought. His mind races—time for a distraction. A test. A big one.

INT. VISUAL STUDIO - LATER

Chris has pulled up the project in Visual Studio, fingers itching to make it right. He’s trying something different—something minimal.

VOICE (SURVEILLANCE #1)
(calm, robotic)
Cool, we created a new Programmer archetype recently. I wasn’t sure if it was ready for prime time, but I'll allow it.

VOICE (GOD #1)
(booming, omnipotent)
It’s fine. Let’s see what happens when he presses Control + Shift + B.

Chris presses the keyboard shortcut. The screen flickers. The error reappears.

ON SCREEN:

Error Message:

MSB4025: The project file could not be loaded...

Chris:
(under his breath)
Not again. Okay, okay.

He grabs his phone, typing quickly, as if summoned.

TEXT MESSAGE ON SCREEN:
Chat GPT suggestion: Put the error message in a README.md file.

Chris:
(smirking)
A README file. Right.

INT. A DIMLY LIT ROOM - UNKNOWN TIME

The setting shifts. The scene is ethereal, somewhere between reality and abstraction. A God (invisible, but their voice echoes) speaks to Chris, the Programmer, who is lost in thought.

VOICE (GOD #2):
(narrating)
Take that crap out of Program.cs and put it in the README.md. This is a family-friendly version of this.

Chris looks at his screen, then decisively drags and drops the text into the README.md file. He clicks "Save" with a flourish.

INT. OFFICE - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

Chris refocuses. He’s not stopping. Not now.

He begins typing again—his fingers moving swiftly, almost instinctively.

VOICE (SURVEILLANCE #2)
Who knew? The Canticle of the Turning has been decreasing in frequency for a while. I thought we’d never hear it again.

VOICE (GOD #3 Jason Bulgrin)
Let’s see if he realizes the significance.

Chris’s fingers stop. He smiles, shaking his head, typing something almost unknowable.

Chris:
(quietly to himself)
Canticle of the Turning... Wait. What does that even mean?

INT. OFFICE - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

Chris is typing again. His concentration is laser-focused. He hits the keyboard: a minimalist Main method.

Chris:
(under his breath)
I’m going to make this the smallest one ever.

ON SCREEN:

csharp
Copy
void main(string[] a){}
VOICE (GOD #4 Chris Rowe)
(chuckling, impressed)
That’s... interesting.

The screen flickers, as though the very fabric of existence is being tested. The Programmer stares at the screen, lost in thought, the lines of code reflecting on his face.

VOICE (GOD #5 Debasish Guha)
(aside, to self)
I didn’t actually catch the color thing when I created the test. How embarrassing. I’ll fix that later.

VOICE (MANAGER GOD Kristi McCombs)
(narrating)
Ask him again, but this time, let’s look more closely at the output.

VOICE (TEST GOD Bryan Berndt)
(voice sharp, as though a new force is in play)
What is the minimalist version of a console app as it would display in Notepad?

INT. OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Chris stares blankly at the screen. The atmosphere has shifted. He grabs his phone and starts typing furiously into a new Chat GPT window.

TEXT MESSAGE ON SCREEN:
What is the minimalist version of a main method for a .NET 9 console app as it would display in Notepad?

INT. ETHERIAL SPACE - TIMELESS

A second, more abstract presence, CHAT GPT ANONYMOUS, responds. The glowing text appears on Chris’s screen as though it’s being typed out in real-time.

CHAT GPT ANONYMOUS:
(static, but readable)

csharp
Copy
void main() {}
CHRIS
(muttering)
Almost. But not quite.

He deletes a space and retypes it with fierce determination. The screen refreshes.

CHAT GPT ANONYMOUS:

csharp
Copy
void main(){}
CHRIS
(nods, content)
That's better. But still... not enough.

VOICE (SURVEILLANCE #3 Nick Vavra)
How many times will he break reality?

VOICE (GOD #6 Brian Lehnen)
(slightly amused)
Oh, he’s going to do it again. It gets ridiculous after a while.

INT. OFFICE - NIGHT

Chris is deep into the code now. The night outside is still, the city lights shining through the window. He types the final sequence—no space, no clutter.

ON SCREEN:

csharp
Copy
void main(){}
The screen flickers one last time. A beat.

VOICE (GOD)
(whispers, intrigued)
Okay. This is it. This... is it.

The camera zooms in on Chris's focused face. The light from the screen reflects in his eyes. He leans back, a small smile creeping onto his lips. The minimalist version of existence—reduced to the simplest form.

VOICE (GOD #7 Nathan Arendt)
(softly)
Now the real test begins.

FADE TO BLACK.
