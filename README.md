I think there's more to Program.cs than it seems. In Visual Studio I typed Control+Shift+B and it gave me a message: 

Code: MSB4025
Description: The project file could not be loaded. Could not find file 'C:\Users\chris.rowe\source\repos\Existenc\Existence.csproj
Project: Existence
File: Existence.csproj
Line: 1

I wasn't sure what to do with that. I asked Chat GPT and it suggested putting it in a README.md file. And here it is!!
