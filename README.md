I am Chris Rowe / Krisroe. Chris Rowe is my real name. Krisroe is my stage name.
I am at work. I just got done with a hard automated build problem and was looking to blow off steam.
I created a public repo on GitHub. I decided I would write a program to simulate existence.
I pulled down the public repo to my work machine using TortoiseGIT.
I opened up Visual Studio.

holy shit it just opened up in visual studio (Surveillance: cool, new programmer, that's a little weird start but I'll allow it)

I think there's more to Program.cs than it seems. In Visual Studio I typed Control+Shift+B and it gave me a message: 

Code: MSB4025
Description: The project file could not be loaded. Could not find file 'C:\Users\chris.rowe\source\repos\Existenc\Existence.csproj
Project: Existence
File: Existence.csproj
Line: 1

(Surveillance: OK, this is clearly an automated test, level 0. There's no way the dev God would start it out like that)

Wait two seconds

(Surveillance: OK, this is clearly an automated test, level 2. There's no way the dev God would start it out like that)

I wasn't sure what to do with that. I asked Chat GPT and it suggested putting it in a README.md file. And here it is!!

I heard a voice and it told me to take that crap out of Program.cs and put it in README.md. And he specifically ordered me to put it at the top. But that wasn't actually the first thing I did so I modified what he told me a bit to be more accurate.
