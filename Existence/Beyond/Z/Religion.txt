Religious Tenets

1. We live in a simulation.
2. Metaphysical data can be tied to a physical object.
3. Destroying a physical object releases related metaphysical data to the 
containing simulation.

Rules
1. Maintain a list of sins.

A sin is something where you did the wrong thing and it bothers you somehow. A full
list is not needed, but particularly note those that bother you or where you think
you could have done better in other circumstances, or where you learned or should
have learned a lesson.

1a. Sins have a sin type for classification purposes.
1b. Try to date when sins occured (date/year or age ranges)
1c. A sin may have a later act of atonement atoning for the sin. Acts of atonement
should be thematically related to the past disrespect.
1d. Consequences or karma can be tied to sins as appropriate.

2. Maintain a healthy disrespect for religion.

Document relevant examples, which may or may not be sins. Keep track of whether
the disrespect is present or past and whether atoned for. Atoning is an opportunity 
to replace more problematic disrespect with less problematic disrespect. Private 
disrespect can be less problematic than public disrespect, if it's okay to hide.
Ambiguous disrespect can be less problematic than unambiguous disrespect.
