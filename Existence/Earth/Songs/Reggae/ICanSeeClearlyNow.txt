I can see clearly now (Jimmy Cliff version, originally recorded by Johnny Nash, doesn't actually connect to Bob Marley)

I can see clearly now, the rain is gone.
I can see all obstacles in my way.
Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind.
It's gonna be a bright (bright), bright (bright) ['n] sunshine-y day.
It's gonna be a bright (bright), bright (bright) ['n] sunshine-y day.

Oh yes, I can make it now, the pain is gone.
All of the bad feelings have disappeared.
Here is that rainbow I've been prayin' for.

It's gonna be a bright (bright), bright (bright) ['n] sunshine-y day.

Look all around! There's nothing but blue skiiies! (3 i's)
Look straight ahead! There's nothing but blue skiiiiiiiies! (8 i's)

I can see clearly now, the rain is gone.
I can see all obstacles in my way.
Here is that rainbow I've been praying for.

It's gonna be a bright (bright), bright (bright) ['n] sunshine-y day.
It's gonna be a bright (bright), bright (bright) ['n] sunshine-y day.
Rah, rah, rah, rah.
Bright (bright), bright (bright) ['n] sunshine-y day.
Yeah, eh.
It's gonna be a bright (bright) ['n] sunshine-y day.
It's gonna be a bright (bright), bright (bright) ['n] sunshine-y day.
It's gonna be a bright (bright), bright (bright) ['n] sunshine-y day.
Rah, rah, rah, rah, rah.

Meaning: Previously, there has been a period of rain, which prevented the singer from seeing clearly.
