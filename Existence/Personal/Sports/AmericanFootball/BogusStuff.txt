The next year where September 11th is a Sunday
This is obviously from a future season, where the Browns play the AFC South and NFC North (2029 + 12x), and has 9 home games (odd year season).
Next years where this could be the pattern are 2089/2101/2185/2281/2377/2461/2557/2653/2749/2833
Minnesota Vikings should be here as a road game (Lions/Vikings as road games does not make sense given the current cycle)
Houston Texans should be here as a road game (Colts/Texans as road games makes sense given the current cycle)

17th game pattern
2021. AFC E vs NFC E, AFC N vs NFC W, AFC S vs NFC S, AFC W vs NFC N
2022. AFC E vs NFC W, AFC N vs NFC E, AFC S vs NFC N, AFC W vs NFC S
2023. AFC vs AFC (this means The San Diego Chargers are the AFC team played based on standings)
2024. 
2025. 
2026. AFC vs AFC
