The next year where September 11th is a Sunday and satisfies (2029 + 12x) for some x is 2089. Next years where this could be the pattern are 2089/2101/2185/2281/2377/2461/2557/2653/2749/2833.
This is obviously from a future season, where the Browns play the AFC South and NFC North (2029 + 12x), and has 9 home games.
Reference year for AFC South Home/Away matchups is 2023, when the Browns were at home against IND/HOU (at TEN/JAX) (always the case for 2029+12x).
2089 Reference year for NFC North Home/Away matchups is 2021, when the Browns were at home against DET/CHI (at GB/MIN)
2101 is opposite, Browns at DET/CHI and at home against GB/MIN
