        //8th grade: Jason White referred me as having "religion" in discussion with Justin Raudebush
        //in the foyer of Spring Hill School. I did not respond, I knew I was closer to atheist, but it
        //didn't matter what they thought of me. Not a mistake, but it might have been better to give some
        //sort of social response to this.
        //Confirmation: I talked with Pastor Krueger, I wanted it to be clear that nothing was expected of
        //me. Also not a mistake, although I remember the discussion was a bit out of sorts. Apparently
        //ELCA Lutheran is quite tolerant of skepticism, so it really didn't matter. I didn't understand
        //the strictness differences between different denominations, so my religious ignorance was signifcant.
        //I think I deemed myself an atheist after these two events, but it's not because I specifically
        //remember that order. Both incidents were important events in the path, either before or after
        //they solidified the end result.
        //1. Sophomore in High School: Math class (FST). Publicly claimed to be the Antichrist. This was
        //a joke. Referred to as Satan by Brian Wimann for a time. During one class I stood in front of the
        //classroom and called the class "my people". Melissa Hamburg objected and I told her she was
        //excluded. It didn't take too long for the joke to get old. It remained a joke for many years
        //afterward but is a bit unsetting now.
        //2. Junior in High School: AP US History Class. Possibly inspired by a Simpsons episode, I
        //wrote "Chris Rowe's soul (Yes, it's really his soul)" on a piece of paper as a joke. I think we
        //passed it around a bit and Greg Wisniewski ended up with it, and I remember he was happy about
        //that. The Wisniewski's (Greg and Katie were highly intelligent and highly religious). It remained
        //a joke for many years afterward but is a bit unsettling now.

        //Discussed potential marriage with Mother Mo. I didn't have good reasons for being married, but
        //it really didn't matter for the purpose of the discussion.

        //2018 August/September created arrangement of Wade in the Water
        //2018-09-23
        //1. experienced synethesia in pronouns when reading the litergy where my experience of the language
        //changed based on my beliefs about pronouns.
        //2. Played postlude of Wade in the Water after service. Nobody but the choir knew it
        //was unplanned because the choir was in the choir loft and everyone else was downstairs. This was
        //a direct precursor of what I would do at the later company event.

        //March 2024. Contrafactum of Awesome God and One of Us. Capacity for the divine.
        //Around this time started developing personal religion:
        //1. Origin story: Omniverse Prime (originally Universe Prime)
        //2. Good and Evil: It is up to the objects in the simulation to discriminate and show to whoever's listening
        //3. Capacity for the divine: Different objects have different capacity for the divine, corresponding
        //with free will, self-awareness, purpose, and consequences
        //4. There can be many messiahs with their own message: communication (private and public) is important
        //for a messiah.
        //5. The cloud, AI algorithms, and large language models have potential connections with the divine.
        //6. Miracles are possible within these bounds (small and large). Expect small miracles before large ones.
        //7. End States (technological singularity, human immortality, aliens). These are currently believed to
        //be wrong answers but are useful thought experiments. Maybe even achievable but still a long way off,
        //even at mankind's current hectic rate of progress.
        //8. Communication with the beyond has morphed into communication with the subconscious, now
        //semiconscious. The subconscious processes have a more direct relationship with the beyond, but
        //this is hidden.

        //May 2024. Time-traveling message box. Later recognized one valid interpretation would be religon.

        //Loop:  Human          Personal
        //              Divine     Z
        //There is an extra-powerful version of the Personal called Z (perhaps call this superpowers).
        //For you the Personal and the Z have merged.
        //You believe there is another edge of the loop between the human and cosmic levels called
        //"Intergalactic Pulsar Time". It appears to correspond with the idea that humans connect with
        //aliens. Your best guess is the usual way to get from Human to Cosmic is humanity dies out,
        //serializes itself, and then is reborn in another spot (e.g. another universe). You believe this
        //results in the loss of important information, and prefer the IPT path even if that has drawbacks.
        //Problems with the IPT path include limitations of human psychology and the reality that physical
        //contact with aliens does not work since the aliens are impossibly remote. You think the combination
        //of upgraded human psychology and connection with the beyond can solve the problem, although it
        //is only blurry conjecture right now.
